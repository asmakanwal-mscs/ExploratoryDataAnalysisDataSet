# Titanic EDA Project

## 1. Introduction
The Titanic dataset is a classic and widely used dataset for introductory data science and machine learning tasks. It contains information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which tragically sank in 1912. The dataset includes features such as passenger age, gender, ticket class, fare, and whether or not they survived.

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to:

Understand the structure and contents of the dataset

Identify patterns and relationships between variables (e.g., age, sex, class) and survival

Clean and preprocess the data for potential future modeling

Generate meaningful visualizations to communicate findings

Summarize key insights that could help in building a predictive model

This project focuses purely on the data exploration phase, laying the groundwork for more advanced tasks such as machine learning classification.
